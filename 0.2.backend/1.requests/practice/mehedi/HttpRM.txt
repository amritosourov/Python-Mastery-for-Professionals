1.  GET- GET method is used to retrieve information
         from the given server using a given URI.


2.  POST- POST request method requests that a web server
          accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message,
          most likely for storing it.


3.  OUT- The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity
         be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers
         to an already existing resource, it is modified and
         if the URI does not point to an existing resource,
         then the server can create the resource with that URI.


4.  DELETE- The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.


5.  HEAD- The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request,
          but without the response body.
          

6.  PATCH- It is used for modify capabilities. The PATCH request only needs
           to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.
