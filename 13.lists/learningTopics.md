## Creating Lists:

Syntax for creating lists.
Creating empty lists and lists with elements.
## List Operations:

Indexing and slicing.
Iterating through lists.
Adding, updating, and removing elements.
## List Methods:

append(), extend(), insert().
remove(), pop(), clear().
index(), count().
sort(), reverse().
## List Comprehensions:

Basic syntax and use cases.
Using conditionals within comprehensions.
Nested comprehensions.
## List Functions:

Built-in functions like len(), min(), max(), sum().
map(), filter(), reduce() (from functools).
## Copying Lists:

Shallow vs. deep copy.
Using slicing, copy(), and the copy module.
## Multi-dimensional Lists:

Creating and working with lists of lists.
Accessing elements in multi-dimensional lists.
## List Performance Considerations:

Time complexity of common list operations.
Memory usage.
## Common Use Cases:

Common algorithms and operations using lists (e.g., searching, sorting).
Practical applications in problem-solving.
List Iteration and Comprehension in Context:

Practical examples of using list comprehensions.
Using lists in real-world scenarios.

Advanced List Comprehensions:
