Basics of Strings:

Definition: A string is a sequence of characters.
Creation: Using single quotes ('), double quotes ("), triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """).
String Operations:

Concatenation: Using +.
Repetition: Using *.
Length: Using len() function.
String Indexing and Slicing:

Accessing characters by index: string[index].
Negative indexing: string[-1] (last character).
Slicing: string[start:stop:step].
String Methods:

upper(), lower(), capitalize(), title(), swapcase().
strip(), lstrip(), rstrip().
replace(old, new), split(separator), join(iterable).
find(substring), index(substring), count(substring).
startswith(prefix), endswith(suffix).
String Formatting:

Using % operator.
Using str.format() method.
Using f-strings (formatted string literals): f"Hello, {name}!".
Escape Sequences:

Common ones: \n (newline), \t (tab), \\ (backslash), \' (single quote), \" (double quote).
Raw Strings:
